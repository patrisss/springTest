Hello!

Here is a little description of my solution.
1. The reason I chose to start with Spring 5 is because it makes the life easier. We don't have to initiate the objects everytime, it is widely used and lots of information is on the internet so in case of issues, there are high changes to find solutions online. Spring 5 also support a lot of additional libraries , also feign client and can be extended to api tests. The only drawback I see about using Spring is that you have to understand and know a bit about how it works in order to integrate it.
2. The chose I made for test ng, lombok and the structure of the tests is simply because this is what I currently use and I am used to them and find them very helpful.
